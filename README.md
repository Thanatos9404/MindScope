### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd "MindScope"
```

2. **Set up the backend**
```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Start the backend server**

```

4. **Open the frontend**
- Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
- Or serve with a local server:

## Development

### Backend API

The backend provides a REST API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/questions` - Get assessment questions
- `POST /api/assess` - Process assessment and get results
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback

### Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript. It communicates with the backend API to:

- Load questions dynamically
- Submit assessment responses
- Display personalized results and recommendations

### Adding Questions

Edit `data/questions.json` to add or modify assessment questions. Each question should follow this structure:
```
{
"id": "unique_id",
"text": "Question text",
"category": "anxiety|depression|stress|wellbeing",
"scale": "phq9|gad7|dass21|who5",
"required": true,
"options": [
{"value": 0, "label": "Option 1"},
{"value": 1, "label": "Option 2"}
]
}
```
